    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'.

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'.

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'.

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

Some of the highlights expected to feature are the battle between Seb Coe and Steve Cram in the 1500m at Los Angeles 1984, where Daley Thompson also made headlines in the Decathlon. Steve Redgrave's attempt to claim a fifth rowing gold medal at Sydney 2000 is sure to be high up the list, as are Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell's exploits in the men's 100m and women's 400m hurdles at Barcelona 1992. London 2012 saw Team GB claim a record number of gold medals, with sporting luminaries such as Bradley Wiggins, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Andy Murray and Mo Farah proving why they were household names, and new stars such as Nicola Adams, Laura Trott and Anthony Joshua burst onto the sporting landscape.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

The pressure to build more houses in such a small country has left Prince Albert with a challenge. Cameras follow him as he attends meetings about a huge two-billion-euro land extension project he has initiated. Extending into the sea is a complex operation, but once complete the largest villas there are estimated to sell for around 100million euros.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">International art sensation Keith Haring blazed a trail through the art scene of 1980s New York and revolutionised the worlds of pop culture and fine art.

Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics.

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

Built as if carved out of the rock, the price is 'only' £23million because it doesn't have a sea view. The pressure to build more houses in such a small country has left Prince Albert with a challenge. Cameras follow him as he attends meetings about a huge two-billion-euro land extension project he has initiated. Extending into the sea is a complex operation, but once complete the largest villas there are estimated to sell for around 100million euros.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Britain's Coronavirus Gamble - Panorama</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Keith Haring: Street Art Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">International art sensation Keith Haring blazed a trail through the art scene of 1980s New York and revolutionised the worlds of pop culture and fine art. When he was diagnosed with Aids in 1989, he asked writer John Gruen to write his biography, and the subsequent audio interviews form the basis of this profile. They are combined with archive footage and contributions from friends, critics and contemporaries, telling the artist's story from the sleepy Pennsylvania of his youth to the clubbing scene of New York and to the streets, where he made his instantly recognisable graffiti-like art.(n)</desc>

Before its current management took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and anti-social behaviour was very common.

Sadly the facilities are very tired and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on, so the Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics.

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

Cezanne, Monet and Renoir were captivated by the light and colour of the landscape in the 19th century and their resultant work advertised the region's beauty. Meanwhile, the area's vivid hues inspired Henri Matisse to adopt a new palette that set modern art on the route to abstraction.(n)</desc>

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

One by one, the porter takes each suitcase away, and the Twirlywoos move down the line, hiding behind different cases. When there is only one suitcase left, the Twirlywoos have nowhere else to hide. Instead of coming out from their hiding place, they take their hiding place with them - much to the porter's confusion. Back on The Big Red Boat, a mischievous mouse entertains on the Twirlywoo Screen. Where is he hiding?(n)</desc>
