    <desc lang="en">Armchair fan Jack turns his comedic sights on Britain's attitude towards its sporting heroes, examining the delight the nation takes in building its sports stars up, as well as bringing them crashing down again. From the red cards and free kicks of David Beckham to Andy Murray's difficult route to the top of tennis and Zola Budd's infamous 1984 Olympic tangle, Jack looks at why it doesn't matter how incredibly talented a person is - if they want to become a British hero, they are not in for an easy ride.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'.

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jane Austen: Behind Closed Doors</title>
    <desc lang="en">Historian Lucy Worsley embarks on a road trip across England to take in some of the places Jane Austen lived in and visited during her lifetime. She aims to demonstrate how Jane's personal experiences influenced the central themes of home and property in her novels, and makes use of detective-work to recreate some of the most important locations that no longer stand. She begins in Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire, retracing a journey that marked one of the many times the Austens veered wildly between wealth and genteel poverty - mirroring the Dashwoods of Sense and Sensibility.

    <title lang="en">My Friend Jane</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on the lives of Jane Austen super-fans, who read, live and breathe all-things Regency. While Austen's works are often considered genteel romances, they are often shot through with acid-sharp wit, social commentary, and a hint of biography, with certain elements from her famous novels more than mirroring aspects of Jane's own life. Here, the self-professed 'Janeites' share their thoughts on why they have fallen in love with Austen's genteel narratives, and explain what the work of a vicar's daughter from Hampshire who died 200 years ago means to them.(n)</desc>
