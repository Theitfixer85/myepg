    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'. Dr Faye Kirkland investigates this approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, asking whether it was a dangerous gamble with people's lives or a sound scientific method. Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation urged countries to stamp out infections as soon as they developed, but the UK government's initial scientific advice said the route out of the crisis was for most of us to catch the virus so we could develop 'herd immunity'.

Faced with a growing backlash and warnings that the NHS was close to being overwhelmed, politicians denied herd immunity was the policy and within a few days Britain pivoted to a new strategy - lockdown.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A House Through Time</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Olusoga charts the history of the Liverpool house from 1945 to the present day. Young newlyweds moved into the attic at the end of the war, but then the house fell into rapid decline and after a family of seven stayed there, it was marked for demolition, narrowly avoiding the wrecking ball by a strange twist of fate. Abandoned, it was eventually rescued in the 1970s by an enterprising group of local activists and turned into a home for creative people. Finally, David meets the current owner Gaynor, who has restored the home to its former glory.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Danger Mouse and Penfold are celebrating another noisy victory, gleefully ringing Big Ben's bell when an over-excited Penfold falls, pushing the clock hand forward, causing the sun to go down prematurely. Unbeknownst to them a mysterious figure watches on from nearby noting the clock's incredible time-controlling powers. When DM realises that the day is being stolen and replaced with a silent night, he enlists the help of expert colleagues - the night shift! With Danger Moth and Danger Mole in tow the team tracks the quiet culprit - but a noisy Danger Mouse might just be outwitted by this stealthy saboteur.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Catching a Killer: A Diary from the Grave</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">When elderly teacher Peter Farquhar was found dead at home in the village of Maids Moreton in 2015, it was sad and unexpected, but no one thought it suspicious. But 18 months later, when his neighbour Ann Moore-Martin also fell ill and died, the police decided to look again. They found that Ben Field, a would-be vicar and academic, had recently become part of both of their lives and benefited from their wills. This programme shows that by delving back in time through friends' and loved ones' memories of Peter and Ben's relationship, as well as Peter's diary, the police discovered a story of love and betrayal.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Witches: A Century of Murder</title>
    <desc lang="en">Suzannah Lipscomb's investigation into the notorious 17th-century witch trials concludes with a profile of Matthew Hopkins, the opportunistic puritan witch-hunter who transformed paranoia about Satanism into a lucrative business as he hanged hundreds of people for crimes they could not possibly have committed. Making use of contemporary reports, Suzannah paints a portrait of a man who believed he could cross any boundary and break any law to achieve his goals. Naming himself 'Witchfinder General', Hopkins toured the country charging fees for his services, but Suzannah's research reveals that ultimately, the public's distaste for witches was not as strong as its hatred of being conned by charlatans. Hopkins would eventually die of tuberculosis in relative obscurity, but his malign legacy lived on across the Atlantic, as witch-hunts began in Salem, Massachusetts.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Mersey is one of Britain's most magnificent rivers, running 70 miles from Stockport to the Irish Sea. This documentary reveals how the waterway has been at the heart of British shipbuilding for more than 180 years, from the first aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal to the latest, HMS Prince of Wales. It has also been important for business, with 40 per cent of all world trade coming through Liverpool's docks in the 19th century, and played a key role in the Allied victory during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt's Valley of Kings remains one of the greatest archaeological finds of all time. But when Howard Carter broke through the sealed entrance to reveal thousands of priceless artefacts and the teenage body of the boy king, rumours of the Pharaoh's revenge consumed the media. And when Carter's benefactor Lord Carnarvon suddenly died, the belief that a deadly curse had been unleashed ran like wildfire. This documentary looks back at Carter and Carnarvon's discovery, and explores the truth behind the stories of the curse.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Life aboard the most famous ocean liner in the world, now a floating hotel in Dubai. Bigger than Titanic, she transported rock stars and royalty and sailed over six million miles, circumnavigating the globe 25 times before being retired.

In this episode, the first VIP guests are due to check in and top chef Dino and his team have a big event planned - a traditional Burns night supper for 200 guests.(n)</desc>

There's a break for a bit of skinny dipping, before the trio fish go fishing, and stay in a strange cabin deep in the woods, surviving on beans and bourbon. They then hit the state capital of Austin, dressing as cowboys in the local bar and at the rodeo, before one last barbecue supper of slow-smoked beef brisket, pork ribs and spicy sausage.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">France v England. Jim Rosenthal presents a chance to see the semi-final at Stadium Australia in Sydney, as the sides battled it out for the right to face the hosts in the final. England went into the match as favourites and looked to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson for inspiration, and his form off the kicking tee proved to be crucial. The French thrashed Ireland in the quarter-finals to reach the last four, but torrential rain in Sydney was to prove a key factor in the match, with Sir Clive Woodward's men coping much better with the conditions. With analysis from Austin Healey, Will Carling and Francois Pienaar, and commentary by John Taylor and Steve Smith.(n)</desc>
