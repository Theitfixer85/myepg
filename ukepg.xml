    <desc lang="en">An exploration of the upland area of North Yorkshire, where heather-clad uplands and sheltered dales have been shaped both by the elements and by its people. Hardy Swaledale sheep roam the high moors all year round only coming down to the lowlands for lambing and shearing. Red grouse feed and breed amongst the heather alongside curlews and other ground nesting birds and billions of purple heather blooms provide nectar for the bees, brought to the moors by beekeepers in the summer. Toby Jones narrates, as time-lapse camera techniques bring fresh insight into the restless rhythms of the region.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Return of the documentary taking a look at what can happen when families fall out over money. The first episode examines the case of a teenager cheated out of her grandfather's inheritance by her own dad and stepmother. The pair forged signatures and lied to solicitors and banks to steal the money, then frittered it away on luxuries and paying off their own debts. There is also the story of a pair of identical twins who fell out over a £55,000 loan, and a man who was alleged to have robbed his mother's pension and life savings, but took his own life before justice was done.(n)</desc>

In 2018, a Miami bridge collapsed killed six people, leaving investigators wondering what turned the $11million structure into a lethal object. Six months later, 43 people were killed when a bridge in Genoa also failed. Back in 1981, the atrium of a new hotel in Kansas City crashed to the ground, costing over 100 lives. Rob discovers how a change in the design of the walkways was responsible. Despite the sad fact that design flaws and construction errors cost lives, Rob reveals how such occurrences also teach engineers how to save them.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp visits the Central American republic of Honduras, where he makes his way to the city of San Pedro Sula. With a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants last year - an average of more than three people each day - Sula has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city on the planet outside of a war zone. Ross discovers how armed drug gangs have taken over many parts of the country, forcing thousands to flee north on a freight train that transports migrants through Guatemala and across Mexico into the United States. But it's an arduous journey and not for the faint-hearted. Even if passengers avoid falling off the roof of the train to their deaths, they face being robbed by bandits, raped, murdered or kidnapped and sold into slavery.(n)</desc>
