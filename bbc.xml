    <desc lang="en">Three-part documentary about the media mogul's influence on international politics and the power struggles within his own family.

Eventually, the full force of his media empire is placed behind the rising Labour leader, but some question how high a price was paid. Elsewhere, Murdoch marries a woman 37 years younger than he is, dividing his children and jeopardising his plans to choose a successor.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Kingmaker</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Three-part documentary about the media mogul's influence on international politics and the power struggles within his own family. The first episode focuses on the build-up to the 1997 general election, where Rupert Murdoch had to decide if his business interests were best served by the continuation of John Major's struggling government, or a new Labour leadership under Tony Blair. Eventually, the full force of his media empire is placed behind the rising Labour leader, but some question how high a price was paid. Elsewhere, Murdoch marries a woman 37 years younger than he is, dividing his children and jeopardising his plans to choose a successor.(n)</desc>

On their journey the pair make their way up the mountains on the lookout for reindeer and one of the hardiest little birds, the ptarmigan. Red squirrels inhabit the pine forests as does another creature that John would love to see - the pine marten. The BBC's world affairs editor proves a fascinating companion with many tales to tell, while the duo wait for the wildlife to appear.(n)</desc>

Eventually, the full force of his media empire is placed behind the rising Labour leader, but some question how high a price was paid.

Hitler calls a general election to increase Nazi representation, but a fire in the Reichstag building is blamed on communists - prompting thousands of arrests of left-wingers.
