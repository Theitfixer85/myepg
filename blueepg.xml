    <desc lang="en">Guy Fieri loves any excuse to bring chefs from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives to Flavortown, so he welcomes a few chefs and their moms for a Mother's Day competition. The DDD chefs are forced to watch as their mothers shop from the chefs' lists, and then the store closes as the chefs are in the middle of their shopping. In the end, one mother-chef duo wins up to $20,000 in a Flavortown shopping spree. (cc).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The bacon masters are back at it again when Guy Fieri welcomes four bacon chefs to Flavortown Market. First, Guy has them make a bacon sandwich after shopping in little, piggy-themed carts. Then, the chefs have to stay under an ingredient weight limit when making their second bacon dish. Finally, the remaining bacon chefs are surprised with a misleading pig chart that gives them insane ingredients to incorporate in their spicy bacon dish. (cc).</desc>

That was then; now it's TV longest running comedy. Not since 'The Flintstones' in the '60s has a cartoon series drawn such a large adult audience, and, ay caramba, given us pop-culture expressions for the ages. And in 1999, Time magazine called it the best TV show of the 20th century. (cc).(n)</desc>

That was then; now it's TV longest running comedy. Not since 'The Flintstones' in the '60s has a cartoon series drawn such a large adult audience, and, ay caramba, given us pop-culture expressions for the ages. And in 1999, Time magazine called it the best TV show of the 20th century. (cc).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Groening's subversive, animated satire about Springfield's hapless first family became a cult favorite when it premiered on Fox in 1989 after first being seen in 1987 as a short on 'The Tracey Ullman Show.' That was then; now it's TV longest running comedy. Not since 'The Flintstones' in the '60s has a cartoon series drawn such a large adult audience, and, ay caramba, given us pop-culture expressions for the ages. And in 1999, Time magazine called it the best TV show of the 20th century. (cc).(n)</desc>
